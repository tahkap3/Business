Himalayan salt is a pink-hued variety of salt that is sourced in the Punjab region of Pakistan, near the Himalayan foothills. These days, the pink salt is everywhere. Not only can you find it in grocery and specialty food stores, but its charming color has also made it a literal fixture in home goods like table lamps.

The origins of the mineral date back hundreds of millions of years, when the salt was deposited in a prehistoric lagoon. Until recently, the Himalayan salt market was fairly small. Now, exports of the popular salt have grown to 400,000 tons of salt each year.

    <h4>3. Aids Weight Loss by Expelling Excess Water from the Cells</h4><br>
    The mineral content of this salt helps to expel excess water from the cells, which can help to reduce bloating and water retention. This can help to reduce overall body weight and can even help to reduce the appearance of cellulite.<br>
    
    <h4>4. Helps in the Management of Muscle Cramps</h4><br>
    Muscle cramps are a common issue that can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and muscle fatigue. Himalayan pink salt helps to alleviate muscle cramps by providing a natural source of electrolytes that can help restore balance in the body.
